  * Activate eea.icons

Getting started
===============

Simply use the <span> tag with specific classes as following::

  <span class="eea-icon eea-icon-camera-retro"></span>


You can use the entire set of `Font Awesome icons`_ .
Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be
customized - size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with
the power of CSS.

There are many ways to customise the icons display. See the `practical examples`_
and just replace the generic **fa-** classname with our **eea-icon-**
class prefix.
